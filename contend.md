# ABOUT_ME.EXE

Hey there! I'm Eren, an AI engineer and founder who believes code can prevent suffering before it starts. Currently building the future of preventive healthcare through computer vision and multimodal AI.

When I'm not training neural networks, you'll find me improvising on piano, or working from random cafés around the world. From athlete to tech builder - I approach startups like sports: it's all about discipline, teamwork, and knowing when to pivot.

## CORE FOCUS
- Computer Vision & ML for healthcare innovation
- Building AI that discovers patterns humans can't see
- Turning academic research into real-world impact
- Remote-first lifestyle with global perspective

## SNAPSHOT STATS
YEARS IN AI: 4+
FUNDING RAISED: €300k
CURRENT MOOD: Caffeinated & Optimistic

## CURRENTLY EXPLORING
- Multimodal health intelligence (movement + voice + face)
- Position-invariant pose estimation algorithms
- Building Munich's next unicorn (relocating 2025 hopefully)
- The intersection of longevity and prevention

# PROJECTS.TAR.GZ

## Previa Health [2025 - Active]
**AI-powered MSK dysfunction prevention**
Built computer vision system detecting movement problems before they become chronic pain. Using proprietary algorithms to analyze biomechanics via smartphone. Validated with clinical datasets, €300k pre-seed secured.
[Tech: Python, TensorFlow, MediaPipe, React, Supabase]

## Athly [2024]
**Multimodal fitness AI (before it was cool)**
Developed autonomous fitness assistant combining voice analysis, camera tracking, and behavioral learning. Predicted optimal workout timing and nutrition - basically built AI agents before ChatGPT made them mainstream.
[Tech: Multimodal ML, React Native, Supabase]

## Energy Forecast System [2023]
**Renewable energy prediction beating meteorologists**
Created LSTM + Random Forest models processing nationwide German weather data. Achieved higher accuracy than standard meteorological systems for agricultural planning. Because clean energy needs smart predictions.
[Tech: Python, Neural Networks, Time Series Analysis, Large-scale Data Processing]
